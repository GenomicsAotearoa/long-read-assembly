The assemblies on the left use older data and assembly methods can't resolve these loci (see all the gaps), while the assemblies on the right use PacBio HiFi data and Hifiasm with trio phasing to successfully resolve these loci, revealing a likely SV in a region affected by a lack of coverage with older sequencing technology.

Sequence Data","text":"<p>Preamble: What Data Are We Using?</p> <p>Genome In A Bottle &amp; HG002 </p> <p>In this workshop we will be using data from HG002, which is a reference sample from the Genome In A Bottle (GIAB) consortium. The GIAB project releases benchmark data for genomic characterization, and you may have seen their benchmark variant calls and regions out in the wild. As part of their benchmarking material generation, they release datasets for their reference samples. We will be using those in this workshop.</p> <p>Family Structure</p> <p>HG002 is actually part of a trio of reference samples. Below is the family listing, also known as the Ashkenazim trio:</p> <ul> <li>HG002: Son</li> <li>HG003: Father</li> <li>HG004: Mother</li> </ul> <p>If you'd like to use data from any of the Ashkenazim trio, there is a set of index files on the GIAB github.</p> <p>There is an excellent HG002 assembly available</p> <p>Since HG002 has so much data to compare against, it is pretty common for new technologies to benchmark on HG002\u2014making even more HG002 data. It has grown into a data ecosystem. This is part of the reason why it was chosen for the T2T consortium as the target for one of its next big pushes: a high-quality diploid T2T genome. This assembly has been worked on by many leading people in the field. And while it is undergoing polishing and is talked about as a draft, it is gapless outside of rDNA arrays and is very good. This makes HG002 a very good sample for testing assembly processes. You can always go back and compare your results against the draft from the T2T consortium.</p>"},{"location":"pages/day1a_read_inputs/#data-for-graph-building-pacbio-ont-data","title":"Data For Graph Building: PacBio &amp; ONT Data","text":"<p>We are going to start by introducing the two long read sequencing technologies that we will be using: PacBio's HiFi and Oxford Nanopore's Ultralong. These two technologies are complementary and each have their own strengths. You can answer some questions more easily with HiFi and some more easily with ONT UL. They can also be used together, and this is important for the concept of a hybrid assembly algorithm where accurate reads are used to create a draft assembly and long reads are used to extend that assembly. </p> <p>In this section, we will learn about both technologies and then create plots showing their characteristic read lengths and qualities. This will help us get a feel for what the data actually looks like in the wild. Lastly, we will prepare this data for use in our assembly section.

PacBio produces such high quality reads (with their single-molecule real-time, or SMRT, sequencing) by reading the same sequence over and over again in order to create a circular consensus sequence (or CCS) as shown below. </p> <p>PacBio's CCS Process </p> <p>Long, highly accurate reads allows for a number of analyses that were difficult or impossible in the context of short reads. For instance, variants can be more easily phased as you can just look for variants that are seen in the same sequencing read since HiFi read lengths span much more than short read lengths. In our context, long accurate reads allow assembly algorithms to build assembly graphs across difficult regions. But it turns out that HiFi reads aren't long enough to span exact repeats in regions like human centromeres.</p>"},{"location":"pages/day1a_read_inputs/#ont-ultralong-lower-quality-but-really-long-reads","title":"ONT Ultralong: Lower Quality But Really Long Reads","text":"<p>Oxford Nanopore's ultralong (UL) sequencing has lower accuracy (~97%), but is really long (even longer than normal ONT).

The CCS process actually produces different data based on a number of different factors, including the number of times a molecule is read (also called subread passes). Raw CCS data is usually filtered for &gt;Q20 reads at which point it is by convention called HiFi.

You can see the hairpin by looking at the 5' and 3' ends and checking that they are reverse complements.</p> Why can we get away with throwing away entire reads that contain adapter sequences? <p>As you can see from the summary statistics from CutAdapt, not many reads in this dataset have adapters/primers. There is some concern about bias\u2014where we remove certain sequences from the genome assembly process. We've taken the filtered reads and aligned them to the genome and they didn't look like they were piling up in any one area.</p> What would happen if we left adapter sequences in the reads? <p>If there are enough adapters present, you can get entire contigs comprised of adapters. This is not the worst, actually, because they are easy to identify and remove wholesale. It is trickier (and this happens more often) when adapter sequences end up embedded in the final assemblies. If/when you upload assemblies to repositories like Genbank they check for these adapters and force you to mask them out with N's. This is confusing to users because it is common to use N's to signify gaps in scaffolded assemblies. So users don't know if they are looking at a scaffolded assembly or masked out sequence.</p>"},{"location":"pages/day1b_familiarise_w_data/#ont-read-length-filtering","title":"ONT Read Length Filtering","text":"<p>Hifiasm is often run with ONT data filtered to be over 50kb in length, so let's filter that data now to see how much of the data remains. </p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>module load SeqKit/2.4.0\nseqkit seq \\\n-m 50000 \\\nont_ul_5k_reads.fq.gz \\\n| pigz &gt; ont_ul_5k_reads.50kb.fq.gz &amp;\n</code></pre> <p>Now we can quickly check how many reads are retained.</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>NanoComp --fastq \\\nont_ul_5k_reads.fq.gz \\\nont_ul_5k_reads.50kb.fq.gz \\\n--names ONT_UL ONT_UL_50kb \\\n--outdir nanocomp_ul_vs_ul_50kb\n</code></pre> When we filter for reads over 50kb, how many reads and total base pairs of DNA are filtered out? <p>Over half of the reads are filtered out, but only about 25% of the data (see \"Total bases\") is filtered.

Now let's actually take a look at how to create Meryl DBs for Verkko assemblies.</p> How would we run Meryl for Verkko? <p>Here is what the Slurm script would look like:</p> <p>(Don't run this, it is slow! We have made these for you already.)</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash -e\n#SBATCH --account       nesi02659\n#SBATCH --job-name      meryl_run\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 32\n#SBATCH --time          12:00:00\n#SBATCH --mem           96G\n#SBATCH --partition     milan\n#SBATCH --output        slurmlogs/%x.%j.out\n#SBATCH --error         slurmlogs/%x.%j.err\nmodule purge\nmodule load Merqury/1.3-Miniconda3\nexport MERQURY=$(dirname $(which merqury.sh))\n## Create mat/pat/child DBs\nmeryl count compress k=30 \\\nthreads=32 memory=96 \\\nmaternal.*fastq.gz \\\noutput maternal_compress.k30.meryl\n\nmeryl count compress k=30 \\\nthreads=32 memory=96 \\\npaternal.*fastq.gz \\\noutput paternal_compress.k30.meryl\n\nmeryl count compress k=30 \\\nthreads=32 memory=96    \\\nchild.*fastq.gz output    \\\nchild_compress.k30.meryl\n\n## Create the hapmer DBs\n$MERQURY/trio/hapmers.sh \\\nmaternal_compress.k30.meryl \\\npaternal_compress.k30.meryl \\\nchild_compress.k30.meryl\n</code></pre> <p>Closing notes</p> <p>It should be noted that Meryl DBs used for assembly with Verkko and for base-level QC with Merqury are created differently. Here are the current recommendations for k-mer size and compression:</p> <ul> <li>Verkko: use <code>k=30</code> and the <code>compress</code> command</li> <li>Merqury: use <code>k=21</code> and do not include the <code>compress</code> command</li> </ul> Why does Verkko use compressed Meryl DBs while Merqury does not? <p>The biggest error type from long read sequencing comes from homopolymer repeats. So assembly graphs are typically constructed from homopolymer compressed data. After the assembly graph is created the homopolymers are added back in. Verkko compresses the HiFi reads for you, but you need to give it homopolymer compressed Meryl DBs so they play nicely together. Merqury on the other hand is used to assess the quality of the resultant assembly, so you want to keep those homopolymers in order to find errors in them.</p> Why does Merqury use <code>k=21</code> ? <p>Larger K sizes give more conservative results, but this comes at a cost since you get lower effective coverage. For non-human species, if you know your genome size you can estimate an optimal K using Meryl itself. If you are wondering, Verkko uses k=30 in order to be \"conservative\". And at the time of writing this document, different species typically stick with <code>k=30</code>. Though this hasn't been tested, so it may change in the future.</p> Do Meryl DBs have to be created from Illumina data? Could HiFi data be used an an input to Meryl? <p>They don't! You can create a Meryl DB from 10X data or HiFi data, for instance. The one caveat is that you want your input data to have a low error rate. So UL ONT data wouldn't work.</p> <p>Other things you could do with Meryl</p> <p>Here is an example of something you could do with Meryl:</p> <ul> <li>You can create a k-mer DB from an assembly</li> <li>You could then print all k-mers that are only present once (using <code>meryl print equal-to 1</code>) </li> <li>Then write those out to a bed file with <code>meryl-lookup</code>.

This has the added benefit of assigning all maternal contigs to the same assembly. Hi-C ensure that an entire chromosome is phased into one haplotype, but across chromosomes the assignment is random. </p> So why wouldn't you always use trio data for phasing? <p>It can be hard to get trio data. If a sample has already been collected it may be hard to go back and identify the parents and collect sample from them. In non-human samples, trios can also be difficult particularly with samples taken from the wild. </p> Are there any difficulties in preparing Hi-C data? <p>Yes! As you can see in the cartoon above Hi-C relies on having intact chromatin as an input, which means it needs whole, non-lysed cells. This means that cell lines are an excellent input source, but frozen blood is less good, for instance.</p>"},{"location":"pages/day1b_familiarise_w_data/#other-phasing-datatypes","title":"Other (Phasing) Datatypes","text":"<p>We should also mention that there are other datatypes that can be used for phasing, though they are less common.</p> <p>Pore-C Pore-C is a variant of Hi-C which retains the chromatin conformation capture aspect, but the sequencing is done on ONT. This allows long-read sequencing of concatemers. Where Hi-C typically has at most one \"contact\" per read, Pore-C can have many contacts per read. The libraries also do not need to be amplified, so Pore-C reads can carry base modification calls. </p> <p>StrandSeq StrandSeq is a technique that creates sparse Illumina datasets that are both cell- and strand-specific. Cell specificity is achieved by putting one cell per well into 384-well plates (often multiple). Strand specificity is achieved through selective fragmentation of nascent strands. (During DNA replication, BrdU is incorporated exclusively into nascent DNA strands. In the library preparation the BrdU strand is fragmented and only the other strand amplifies.)

Hopefully this will help put the data types from yesterday in context. Knowing how each data type is used also helps you to make better decisions when planning your sequencing runs.</p> <p>Both Verkko and Hifiasm can use a variety of data sources:</p> <ul> <li>PacBio HiFi: &gt;10kbp, around 99.9% accuracy</li> <li>Oxford Nanopore Ultralong: &gt;100kb, around 97% accuracy</li> <li>Phasing data from Hi-C or trio Illumina data</li> </ul> <p>PacBio HiFi data is required for both assemblers. Other data types are optional\u2014but they lead to much better assemblies. So let's jump ahead a bit and take a peek at how Verkko creates assemblies using figure 1 from the recent Verkko paper (Rautiainen, Mikko, et al.). It's ok if this is a bit confusing, you don't need to know the inner workings of Verkko in order to make great assemblies.</p> <p>PacBio HiFi is used to create the initial graph </p> <p>Verkko's first theoretical task is to create an assembly graph from HiFi data, but it has to prepare the HiFi reads first. HiFi data is less accurate in homopolymer repeats and microsatellites, so before creating an assembly graph, the reads are \"compressed\" in these regions:</p> <p> </p> <p>The reads are then error corrected. You don't have to worry about how this works (just know that it is very computationally intensive). Once that is done, a graph is created from the HiFi reads:</p> <p> </p> <p>If you aren't familiar with what an assembly graph is, that is also ok! The annoying thing is that there are different ways to make assembly graphs, but they all have the common feature of linking together reads by their overlaps. In this graph the boxes (also called nodes) represent sequences and the lines (also called edges) represent the relationship between those overlaps.</p> <p>Note that in the middle section the orange and blue lines represent the ONT reads aligned to the graph. </p> <p>Oxford Nanopore Data (which is long) helps simplify the graph</p> <p>Using these alignments, nodes that are linked (or phased) by a read are combined. This \"simplifies\" the graph -- in other words, you get nice long nodes where you previously had shorter nodes. (Long nodes are good, they mean you have longer sequences that are assembled.)</p> <p> </p> <p>The graph can now be phased</p> <p>In the case of trio Illumina data, Verkko looks at the nodes and counts the number of maternal-specific or paternal-specific sequences of DNA (from meryl hapmer DBs). If it finds that a node has, for instance, a bunch of maternal specific sequences/k-mers and almost no paternal specific sequences/k-mers then the assembler will assign that node to be maternal. Nodes that are the same haplotype but are separated by a homozygous region are then merged.</p> <p> </p> <p>Finally the assembly graph can be converted into two contigs which represent maternal and paternal haplotypes.</p> <p> </p> <p>Maternal and paternal contigs for the entire assembly are then put into one diploid FASTA as well as two haploid FASTAs.</p> <p>How does Hi-C phasing work?</p> <p>Like using trio data, Hi-C phasing aims to find nodes that are near to each other and come from the same haplotype. To achieve this, Hi-C data is aligned to the graph and reads that are linked across nodes can be used to phase the graph as shown in this figure modified from (Garg, Shilpa): <p> </p> One key difference between trio phasing and Hi-C is that Hi-C data cannot say that a set of nodes all come from the sample's mother or father, only that they come from the same haplotype. </p>"},{"location":"pages/day2a_assembly/#exploring-with-test-data","title":"Exploring With Test Data","text":"<p>Running assemblers is very computationally intensive and the output files can be big.

Verkko is a program that reads in the parameters you gave it and figures out a few things about your verkko installation and then creates a configuration file (<code>verkko.yml</code>) and a shell script (<code>snakemake.sh</code>). The shell script is then automatically executed.</p> <p>Take a look at the shell script that was created for your run</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>cat assembly/snakemake.sh\n</code></pre> <p>It is just a call to Snakemake!!! You can think of Verkko as a tool, but also as a pipeline because it is. This has some advantages. One is that if you know what Verkko is doing (which is somewhat achievable given that the Snakemake rules guide you through Verkko's logic), you can add to it, or even swap out how Verkko performs a given step for how you'd like to do it. It also means that you can restart a run at any given step (if you made a mistake or if the run failed). Lastly, and maybe most importantly, Snakemake supports Slurm as a backend. So if you have access to an HPC you could (and probably should) run Verkko and allow it to launch Slurm jobs for you. (This is in contrast to what we just did which was to run a Slurm job and just allow all jobs to run on the allocated resources that we requested for the entire run.)</p> <p>Now take a look at the jobs that were run</p> <p>You can view the stderr from the run in your Slurm logs, or in Snakemake's logs. Let's take a look at the top of the log:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>head -n 35 assembly/.snakemake/log/*.log\n</code></pre> <p>This shows a list of Snakemake jobs that will get executed for this dataset. There are a few things to note. The first is that for larger datasets some jobs will get executed many times (hence the count column). This dataset is small, so most jobs have <code>count=1</code>. The second thing to note is that these jobs are sorted alphabetically, so we can get a feel for scale, but it's a bit hard to figure out what Verkko is really doing.</p> <p>Open the logs and scroll through them</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>less assembly/.snakemake/log/*.log\n</code></pre> <p>You can see all of the Snakemake jobs, in order, that were run. Even for this tiny dataset there are many. Since there are a lot of jobs, there are a lot of outputs, and these are organized (roughly) by Snakemake rule. Take a look at the output folder in order to familiarize yourself with the layout.</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>ls -lh assembly\n</code></pre> <p>Take a look at the initial HiFi graph</p> <p>Open the <code>assembly/1-buildGraph/hifi-resolved.gfa</code> file in Bandage.

Now our three nodes have been resolved into one. </p> <p>Do we need to phase?</p> <p>We just worked through test data that was HiFi only (Hifiasm) then HiFi + ONT UL (Verkko) so you'd be forgiven for thinking that for these assemblers you don't need phasing data. In truth, if the HiFi and ONT data could produce contigs that are chromosome-level in scale, then trios/Hi-C wouldn't be needed, but assemblers aren't there yet. </p> <p>Let's look at some example data from Hifiasm which was produced with only HiFi for the Eastern Narrow Mouth Toad (Gastrophryne carolinensis). Below is a Merqury kmer count plot for the primary haplotype from this assembly:</p> <p>Hifiasm (primary) assembly without Purge Dups</p> <p><p> </p> This is the primary assembly of a diploid, so we'd like to see the red section have two peaks -- one for heterozygous positions and one for homozygous positions. This is because the primary would ideally represent all of the homozygous regions as well as one set of alleles for heterozygous regions. We'd also like to see almost no blue section (since the blue section represents regions that are represented twice in the assembly), as these mean that a region is being represented twice. Unfortunately there are a lot of kmers seen twice in the assembly. When purge dups (a tool that looks for false duplications based on coverage information) is run, it gets better:</p> <p>Hifiasm assembly with Purge Dups</p> <p><p> </p> But you can see that even after purging duplications, there is a large blue area. Now look what happens when Hi-C phasing is used:</p> <p>Hifiasm assembly (one haplotype) with HiC phasing <p> </p> </p> <p>The blue section reduces in size drastically! So what is happening here?</p> <p>Without phasing data such as trio or Hi-C, Hifiasm will create an assembly graph as you'd expect. Then it will try and figure out what path to walk in order to create a primary and an alternate assembly. It does this by just picking one side of the bubbles it encounters when walking the graph and assigning those to the primary assembly. The other sides gets put in the alternate assembly. In very heterozygous genomes, or very heterozygous regions of a genome, the primary assembly can still retain haplotigs from the alternate allele because the regions may look very different (and therefore don't create a nice bubble in the graph), even though they are still just representing alternate alleles at the same locus. This can result in the same genomic region incorrectly being represented twice in the primary assembly, which we call a false duplication.</p> <p>Verkko for its part, is more conservative. Once Verkko gets to a bubble that it doesn't know how to phase it just stops and you get a break in your assembly.</p>"},{"location":"pages/day2a_assembly/#running-on-full-data-sets","title":"Running on Full Data Sets","text":"<p>We won't be running the full datasets during the workshop, but you are encouraged to do so yourself.

However, it can be hard to compare average contig length between assemblies\u2014if they have the same total size and same number of contigs, it's still the same average, even if it's five contigs of 100bp, or one 460 bp contig and four 10bp ones! This matters for assembly because ideally we want fewer contigs that are larger. </p> <p>Median comes closer to reaching what we're trying to measure, but it can be skewed by having many very small contigs, so instead a popular metric for assessing assemblies is N50.</p> <p>The N50 is similar to the median in that one must first sort the numbers, but then instead of taking the middle value, the N50 value is the length of the first contig that is equal to or greater than half of the assembly sum. But that can be hard to understand verbally, so let's look at it visually:</p> <p> Image adapted from Elin Videvall at The Molecular Ecologist. </p> <p>The N50 can be interpreted as such: given an N50 value, 50% of the sequence in that assembly is contained in contigs of that length or longer. Thus, N50 has been traditionally used as the assembly statistic of choice for comparing assemblies, as it's more intuitive (compared to average contig length) to see that an assembly with an N50 value of 100Mbp is more contiguous than one with an N50 value of 50MBp, since it seems like there are more larger contigs in the former assembly.</p> <p>Another statistic that is often reported with N50 is the L50, which is the rank of the contig that gives the N50 value. For instance, in the above image, the L50 would be 3, because it would be the third largest contig that gives the N50 value. L50 is useful for contextualizing the N50, because it gives an idea of how many contigs make up that half of your assembly. </p> N50 or NG50? <p>Another measurement you might see is NG50. This is the N50 value, just calculated using a given genome size instead of the sum of the contigs.</p> <p>Given how the N50 value can be so affected by addition or removal of small contigs, another metric has come into use: the area under the (N50) curve, or the auN value. Though N50 is measured at the 50% mark, we could make similar values for any value of x, for instance N30 would be the value where 30% of the sequence in that assembly is of that length or longer. These metrics are thus called Nx statistics, and one could plot them against contig length to get an Nx curve, which gives a more nuanced view of the actual contig size distribution of your assembly. </p> <p></p> <p>Image adapted from Heng Li's blog, which in turn adapts it from a NIBS workshop</p> <p>auN tries to capture the nature of this curve, instead of a value from an arbitrary point on it. On the above example, each step on the curve represents a contig (length on the y-axis), so the black curve is the most contiguous as it has one contig that covers over 40% of the assembly. Despite that, this assembly would have the same N50 value (on the x-axis) as multiple other assemblies that are more fragmented in the same area. </p>"},{"location":"pages/day3a_assembly_qc/#run-gfastats-on-a-fasta","title":"Run gfastats on a FASTA","text":"<p>Let's get some basic statistics for an assembly using a tool called gfastats, which will output metrics such as N50, auN, total size, etc. We can try it out on a Verkko trio assembly of HG002 that's already been downloaded onto NeSI.</p> <p>code</p> <p><pre><code>## let's symlink the file in a way that's easier to refer to\ncd ~/lra\nmkdir -p day3_assembly_qc/gfastats\ncd day3_assembly_qc/gfastats\nln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/assemblies/verkko/full/trio/assembly/assembly.*.fasta .\nls -la          # you should see a bunch of \"files\" that are actually symlinks pointing to their actual content\n</code></pre> Now we're ready to roll! <pre><code>module purge\nmodule load gfastats\ngfastats assembly.haplotype1.fasta\n</code></pre></p> <ul> <li>Shouldn't take about 10 seconds </li> </ul> Output <pre><code>+++Assembly summary+++: # scaffolds: 81\nTotal scaffold length: 3025610697\nAverage scaffold length: 37353218.48\nScaffold N50: 112270693\nScaffold auN: 120344050.34\nScaffold L50: 10\nLargest scaffold: 242261106\nSmallest scaffold: 7980\n# contigs: 95\nTotal contig length: 3024505387\nAverage contig length: 31836898.81\nContig N50: 101137168\nContig auN: 98109753.40\nContig L50: 12\nLargest contig: 201096255\nSmallest contig: 7980\n# gaps in scaffolds: 14\nTotal gap length in scaffolds: 1105310\nAverage gap length in scaffolds: 78950.71\nGap N50 in scaffolds: 222184\nGap auN in scaffolds: 267123.76\nGap L50 in scaffolds: 2\nLargest gap in scaffolds: 425849\nSmallest gap in scaffolds: 1000\nBase composition (A:C:G:T): 893171444:618413603:615928136:896992204\nGC content %: 40.81\n# soft-masked bases: 0\n# segments: 95\nTotal segment length: 3024505387\nAverage segment length: 31836898.81\n# gaps: 14\n# paths: 81\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"pages/day3a_assembly_qc/#run-gfastats-on-a-gfa","title":"Run gfastats on a GFA","text":"<p>Remember that the file we initially got was an assembly graph\u2014what if we wanted to know some graph-specific stats about our assembly, such as number of nodes or disconnected components?

Download the <code>read-db.hist</code> file and throw it into the GenomeScope website: http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/genomescope2.0/ and adjust the parameters accordingly.</p> Can I use GenomeScope to QC my raw data before assembly? <p>As you can see here, GenomeScope can be useful for getting an idea of what your raw dataset looks like, as well as feeling out the genome that should be represented by those sequencing reads. This can be useful as a QC step before even running the assembly, to make sure that your dataset is good enough to use. Here's an example of a good diploid dataset of HiFi reads:</p> <p></p> How does the data look? What does the coverage look to be? How many peaks are there in the data and what do they represent? What are some characteristics of the genome as inferred by GenomeScope? <p>This data looks good, and you know that 1) because this tutorial text already called it good previously, and 2) there's a good amount of coverage, around 40X diploid coverage in fact. Additionally, the peaks are all very clear and distinct from each other and from the error k-mer slope on the left. Recall that the first peak represents haploid coverage (i.e., coverage of heterozygous loci) and the second peak is diploid coverage. GenomeScope is predicting the total size of the genome to be about 2.2 Gbp with 1.23% heterozygosity. This is data for Microtus pennsylvaticus, the eastern meadow vole. </p> <p>Here's an example of another HiFi dataset:</p> <p></p> <p>Compare this to the previous examples. Does this look like a good dataset? Ignoring how GenomeScope itself is getting confused and can't get its model to fit properly to the k-mer spectra, let's look at the actual observed k-mer spectra. It does look like there's potentially two peaks whose distributions are overlapping, one peak around 10X and the other just under 20X. These are presumably our haploid and diploid peaks, but there's not enough coverage to resolve them properly here. This is an example of a GenomeScope QC that would tell me we don't have enough HiFi data to continue onto assembly, let's try to generate some more data.  </p> <p></p> <p>Wow, more data! This result is from after adding one more (notably more successful) SMRT cell of HiFi data and re-running GenomeScope. We can see the resolution of the peaks much more cleanly, and the GenomeScope model fits the data much better now, so we can trust the genome characteristic estimates here more than before. If you noted the comparatively small genome size and wondered what this was, it's Anadara tuberculosa, the piangua.</p> <p>Now you might be wondering: what happens if I try to assemble data without enough coverage? Answer: a headache. The assembly that results from the dataset that made the first GenomeScope plot resulted in two haplotypes of over 3,000 contigs each, which is very fragmented for a genome this small, recapitulated by their auN values being ~0.5 Mbp. In comparison, an assembly with the dataset pictured in the second GenomeScope plot resulted in two haplotypes of 500-800 contigs with auN values of 3.6-3.9 Mbp! The improvement in contiguity can also be visualized in the Bandage plots:</p> <p></p> <p>The above is the Hifiasm unitig graph for the assembly done without good HiFi coverage.</p> <p></p> <p>The above is the Hifiasm unitig graph for the assembly done with good (~56X) HiFi coverage.</p>"},{"location":"pages/day3a_assembly_qc/#using-merqury-in-solo-mode","title":"Using Merqury in solo mode","text":"<p>Let's use Merqury on that database we just made to get the QV and some plots.</p> <p>Use your text editor of choice to make a Slurm script (<code>run_merqury.sl</code>) to run the actual Merqury program with the following contents:</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>#!/bin/bash -e\n#SBATCH --account       nesi02659\n#SBATCH --job-name      merqury1\n#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 8\n#SBATCH --time          00:15:00\n#SBATCH --mem           40G\n#SBATCH --output        slurmlogs/%x.%j.log\n#SBATCH --error         slurmlogs/%x.%j.err\n#SBATCH --partition     milan\n## load modules\nmodule purge\nmodule load Merqury\nexport MERQURY=/opt/nesi/CS400_centos7_bdw/Merqury/1.3-Miniconda3/merqury\n\n## create solo merqury dir and use it\nmkdir merqury_solo\ncd merqury_solo\n\n## run merqury\nmerqury.sh \\\n../read-db.meryl \\\n../assembly.fasta \\\noutput\n\ncd -/lra\n</code></pre> What's that <code>export</code> command doing there? <p>Merqury as a package ships with a lot of scripts, especially for plotting.

Take a look at it and try to interpret the QV value you find (third column). If we recall the Phred scale system, this would mean that this QV value is great! Which is not surprising, considering we used HiFi data. It's worth noting, though, that we are using HiFi k-mers to evaluate sequences derived from those same HiFi reads. This does a good job of showing whether the assembly worked with that data well, but what if the HiFi data itself is missing parts of the genome, such as due to bias (e.g., GA dropout)? That's why it's important to use orthogonal datasets made using different sequencing technology, when possible. For instance, we can use an Illumina-based Meryl database to evaluate a HiFi assembly. For non-human vertebrates, this often results in the QV dropping from 50-60 to 35-45, depending on the genome in question. </p>"},{"location":"pages/day3a_assembly_qc/#using-merqury-in-trio-mode","title":"Using Merqury in trio mode","text":"<p>So we just ran Merqury on our E. coli assembly, and evaluated it using the HiFi reads that we used for that assembly.

Do I want to locate genes using de novo prediction models, transcript- or RNA-seq-based evidence, or both? Do I have a reliable source of annotations from the assembly of a related genome? Do I have a collaborator willing and able to perform the annotation for me?</p> <p>A full discussion or tutorial covering the various scenarios is beyond the scope of this workshop, but pipelines like MAKER (Holt and Yandell, 2011; doi: 10.1186/1471-2105-12-491) can be configured to do many of these things, though installing all necessary dependencies can be challenging in some circumstances. Many tools also assume short reads (e.g., when using RNA-seq evidence), and incorporating information from long-read sources may require adjustments.</p> <p>Here we will get a taste for annotation with one popular tool: Liftoff, which makes use of another genome assembly with annotations you wish to \"copy\" onto your assembly.</p> What is the easiest way to annotate my genome of interest ? <p>The easiest way to get a genome annotated is to have someone else do it. If sharing data with NCBI is possible and your assembly is the best option to represent your species of interest, they may be willing to annotate your genome for you using their pipeline. Otherwise, finding a collaborator with expertise is a good option.</p> What are the most common formats for sharing annotation data ? <p>The most common formats are BED (Browser Extensible Data), GFF (Generic Feature Format; v3), GTF (General Transfer Format; a.k.a., deprecated GFF v2), and custom TSV (tab-separated value). Wiggle format and its variants are also common for displaying information in a genome browser.</p> Which tool(s) should I use for my project ? <p>Annotation is a complex problem, and no single tool exists that can be universally recommended. A high-quality annotation plan often requires the use of may tools and/or complex pipelines, and the installation of many of these tools can be complicated, even for expert command-line users. Generally speaking, following the best-practice of those in your field or who work on the same taxa is a reasonable option. In some cases, tools specific to some set of organisms have been developed (e.g., Funannotate for fungi). Recently, the BRAKER team released version 3 of their pipeline for gene structure prediction (wrapping GeneMark-ES/ET &amp; AUGUSTUS). If you have a trustworthy source of annotations from another assembly, you can consider Liftoff and CAT. InterProScan can give you functional annotations relatively quickly. If you are able to share your data with NCBI and your assembly is the best assembly (or if the community agrees it is otherwise preferred), the NCBI annotation team will annotate it for you using their automated pipeline. GFF3 Toolkit can be useful when working with GFF3 files, and gFACs can help with filtering, analysis, and conversion tasks.</p> How can I learn more about annotation ? <p>Please consider the following sources:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Review of eukaryotic genome annotation written for beginners (Yandell and Ence, 2012; doi: 10.1038/nrg3174)</p> </li> <li> <p>Review of assembly and annotation written for conservation geneticists and assuming limited understanding of bioinformatics and high-throughput sequencing (Ekblom and Wolf, 2014; doi: 10.1111/eva.12178)</p> </li> <li> <p>Review of structural and functional annotation, providing definitions and the limitations of annotation (Mudge and Harrow, 2016; doi: 10.1038/nrg.2016.119)</p> </li> <li> <p>Protocol (from protocols.io) for de novo annotation using the MAKER pipeline.

Unlike current coordinate lift-over tools which require a pre-generated \"chain\" file as input, Liftoff is a standalone tool that takes two genome assemblies and a reference annotation as input and outputs an annotation of the target genome. Liftoff uses Minimap2 (Li, 2018; doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/bty191) to align the gene sequences from a reference genome to the target genome. Rather than aligning whole genomes, aligning only the gene sequences allows genes to be lifted over even if there are many structural differences between the two genomes. For each gene, Liftoff finds the alignments of the exons that maximize sequence identity while preserving the transcript and gene structure. If two genes incorrectly map to overlapping loci, Liftoff determines which gene is most-likely mis-mapped, and attempts to re-map it. Liftoff can also find additional gene copies present in the target assembly that are not annotated in the reference.</p> <p>We will use Liftoff (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btaa1016) to lift over the annotations from the T2T-CHM13 reference assembly to our assembly of HG002.</p> <p>Create directory</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>cd ~/lra\nmkdir liftoff-annotation\ncd liftoff-annotation\n</code></pre> <p>Gather the necessary files</p> <p>code</p> <pre><code>ln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/CHM13-T2T.renamed.gff.gz chm13-annotations.gff.gz\nln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/CHM13-T2T.renamed.gff.liftoff.sqlite3 chm13-annotations.gff.liftoff.sqlite3\nln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/chm13v2.0.fa chm13.fa\nln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/chm13/chm13v2.0.fa.fai chm13.fa.fai\nln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/assemblies/verkko/full/trio/assembly/assembly.haplotype1.fasta asm.hap1.fa\nln -s /nesi/nobackup/nesi02659/LRA/resources/assemblies/verkko/full/trio/assembly/assembly.haplotype1.fasta.fai asm.hap1.fa.fai\n</code></pre> What's with the <code>*.sqlite3</code> file? <p>Liftoff stores features from the GFF file in a SQLite database.

Loosely speaking if you take a sequence and get all of its kmers of a certain size and then sort those kmers, you can do a lot with just the \"smallest\" kmer (this is called a minimizer). MashMap uses a set of those smallest kmers to say: this sequence here and my query sequence share a lot of smallest kmers. The output of MashMap is an approximation of read position and identity.

As of the writing of this document (June 2023) for a diploid human assembly you can expect to get around 12 chromosomes assembled T2T in contigs and an additional 12 or so assembled T2T in scaffolds with Verkko. Hifiasm is very similar but without scaffolds. This means that for a diploid verkko assembly about half of the chromosomes are T2T out of the box for ~40X HiFi and &gt;15X (or so) UL ONT with either HiC or trio phasing. Pretty amazing. This sample (HG002) is not very heterozygous so it's actually a tough sample to assemble. That is why we aren't seeing very many T2T contigs/scaffolds.

Visualizing tandem repeats like this requires an assembly that spans all the repeat arrays and assembles them accurately, making this a potent example of the benefits of combining highly-accurate, long reads (like PacBio HiFi) with ultralong reads from ONT in the assembly process with  hifiasm (Cheng et al. 2022) or Verkko (Rautiainen et al. 2023). Take a moment, and consider that. You can\u2019t do this with reads alone (even long reads). Mapping to a good reference (e.g., CHM13-T2T) for your species of interest (if one exists) won\u2019t work either because the alignment software can\u2019t distinguish between repeat copies.</p> What are sketching methods ? <p>Sketching is a technique to create reduced-representations of a sequence. The most widely-known option for sketching is probably minimizers, made particularly popular with tools like minimap2 (Li 2018), which applies minimizers to the alignment problem. We discussed minimizers earlier when running MashMap. The minimizer for any given window is the lexicographically smallest canonical k-mer. Several variants to minimizers exist, e.g., syncmers, minmers, and modimizers, the latter of which is used in ModDotPlot. Each sketching method has different properties depending on how they select the subsequence used to represent a larger area, whether they allow overlaps, whether a certain density of representative sequences is enforced in any given window, whether the neighboring windows are dependent on eachother, etc. In general, the representative sequences are found by sliding along the sequence and selecting a representative subsequence in the given window.</p> <p>Many other tools use sketching in some way, here are a few examples:</p> <ul> <li>Mash (Ondov et al. 2016)</li> <li>MashMap (Kille et al. 2023)</li> <li> <p>MBG (Rautiainen &amp; Marschall 2021)                              &lt;-- Used in                 Verkko                 (Rautiainen et al. 2023)!</p> </li> <li> <p>hifiasm (Cheng et al. 2022)</p> </li> </ul> <p>We're going to run ModDotPlot on part of the Y chromosome from our earlier assembly. First we\u2019ll need to identify the appropriate chunk, which can be done a few different ways depending on the sequence you\u2019re looking for. ChrY somtimes appears tied on only one end to chrX in the Bandage plot, making it easy to identify the Y node (which is shorter than the longer X node). This method may not get all of the Y chromosome because it may be in separate pieces (i.e., it isn\u2019t T2T), and we often see chrX and chrY untangled from eachother in one or two pieces each, so topology of the graph isn\u2019t always a reliable option (though, we recommend labelling the graph with the chromosome names to get a feel for how your assembly looks). The ideal way is to map some known sequence against your assembly or to map your assembly against a known reference.
